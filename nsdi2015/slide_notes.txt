To add?
- Viewpoint into modern web traffic? E.g., HTTPS increase over time.
- How much SPDY helps.
- Redundancy elimination?
- Picking WebP quality.
- Alternate designs: VPNs, transparent proxies, agressive optimizations.
- middlebox tampering
- Safe Browsing?

Improvements:
- "On the whole, the contribution of individual mechanisms varies significantly based on characteristics of clients and sites."
- In the desktop environment, we solve these issues with massive
  overprovisioning.

Possible discussion points:
- Implications for bandwidth pricing?
- Negative result: geodistribution, even in US, doesnâ€™t really help latency.
- Negative result: PLT as a metric.
- Link header is better than SPDY push?
