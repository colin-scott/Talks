Symbolic Execution:
  - General technique for enumerating the possible executions of a program
  - Way it works: mark all inputs as symbols.
  - For every conditional in the program, ask a constraint solver.
  - very broad technique.

This paper:
  - Focus on one particular type of bug: interoperability.
  - Is there a message emmited by sender that is rejected by receiver?
  - Requires a bit of annotation from the user to know what is rejected.

Two contributions:
   - `Joint analysis'
   - heuristics for searching the exponential space.
