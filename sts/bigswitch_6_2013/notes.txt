 - Make clear the use-case: simulator generates trace, not production logs
 - Introduce the simulator sooner
 - Motivate why we're talking about subtleties. Delta debugging is the easy
   part, but getting the replay to work is our contribution
 - Good questions woman: Rashmi
 - What kinds of bugs do we catch? [mention headerspace analysis]
 - Insert reference to tech report
 - Parallel execution? -> thoughts
 - Another optimization (Lamport): small number of actors: ignore events for
   unrelated nodes.
 - Shouldn't this be applicable to other distributed systems
 - Two folks in the ParLab:
     - Cindy Rubio Gonz√°lez
     - Anh Cuong Nguyen

--- From BSN Talk ---

  - Key issue is not complexity, it's overnight parallel fuzzing and
    minimization runs
  - Status slide: improvements and open problems
  - DD visualization too rigid?
  - Call out Daylight
