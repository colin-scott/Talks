 - Make clear the use-case: simulator generates trace, not production logs

 - Good questions woman: Rashmi
 - What kinds of bugs do we catch? [mention headerspace analysis]
 - Insert reference to tech report
 - Parallel execution? -> thoughts

   unrelated nodes.

 - Two folks in the ParLab:
     - Cindy Rubio González
     - Anh Cuong Nguyen
